- Click **Import**

### 2. Add Azure Blob Storage Credential
After importing, add the credential:
1. Click any Azure Blob node with red icon
2. Click **Credential to connect with** â†’ **Create New**
3. Choose **Connection String**
4. Paste:
```
BlobEndpoint=https://saxtechfcs.blob.core.windows.net/;SharedAccessSignature=sp=racwdl&st=2025-08-08T05:00:57Z&se=2030-08-08T13:15:57Z&spr=https&sv=2024-11-04&sr=c&sig=lJKK9jDZ59pJSNkKSgwaQIrCdBaJzx4XPzgEB2/rnIg=
```
5. Name it: **SAXTech Blob Storage**
6. Click **Create**

### 3. Activate & Test
- Toggle **Active** switch
- Test deletion with a test file
- Test upload with duplicate detection
- Test search functionality

## ðŸ§ª **TEST THE FIXES:**

### Test Delete Functionality:
```javascript
// Your HTML already sends this format:
{
  "filePath": "FCS-OriginalClients/TestClient/documents/test.pdf",
  "clientName": "TestClient",
  "category": "documents",
  "fileName": "test.pdf"
}
```
The workflow now:

### Test Large Files:
- Files >10MB will automatically chunk
- Check console for chunking messages

## ðŸ“Š **WORKFLOW STATS:**
- **86 total nodes**
- **68+ connection groups**
- **All credentials embedded** (except Blob Storage for security)
