# üß† Knowledge Graph Status Report
**Date:** December 2, 2024  
**System:** Ask Foreman - SAXTech

## üìä Current Status: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Document Upload Pipeline** - Documents can be uploaded and stored in Azure Blob Storage
2. **n8n Workflow Integration** - Webhooks are processing documents successfully
3. **Chat System** - AI chat is functioning and can answer general construction questions
4. **Document Storage** - Files are being stored in the correct Azure container structure:
   - `FCS-OriginalClients/{client}/{category}/{filename}`
   - `FCS-ConvertedClients/{client}/{category}/{filename}.jsonl`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Not Working:
1. **Entity Extraction** - The system reports "No entities found" even with rich construction documents
2. **Knowledge Graph Building** - Not creating relationships between entities
3. **Azure Function Authentication** - The function keys appear to be incorrect or expired
4. **Document Content Extraction** - PDFs and text files aren't being properly parsed for content

## üîç Test Results:

### Test 1: Document Upload
```bash
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Documents upload to Azure Blob Storage
‚úÖ SUCCESS - n8n webhook accepts and processes files
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Metadata is created
```

### Test 2: Entity Extraction
```bash
‚ùå FAILED - "entitiesExtracted": 0
‚ùå FAILED - "message": "No entities found"
```

### Test 3: Knowledge Graph Query
```bash
‚ùå FAILED - Cannot query relationships (no graph data)
‚ùå FAILED - Cross-client insights not available
```

### Test 4: Chat Integration
```bash
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Chat system responds to queries
‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Can answer general questions but not client-specific
‚ùå FAILED - Cannot access document content for specific queries
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Root Causes:

1. **Azure Functions Not Properly Configured**
   - The `knowledge-graph` function exists in code but may not be deployed
   - Function keys are returning 401 (unauthorized)
   - CORS is blocking browser-based requests

2. **n8n Workflow Limitations**
   - The webhook processes files but doesn't extract entities
   - Knowledge graph building logic may not be implemented in n8n
   - Document parsing appears to be failing silently

3. **Document Processing Pipeline Issues**
   - PDF content extraction is failing
   - Text files aren't being parsed correctly
   - The system stores files but doesn't analyze content

## üöÄ How to Fix:

### Option 1: Deploy Azure Functions (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `azure-functions` directory
2. Deploy the knowledge-graph function:
   ```bash
   cd azure-functions
   func azure functionapp publish saxtech-functionapps
   ```
3. Get the correct function keys from Azure Portal
4. Update the keys in your configuration

### Option 2: Implement in n8n Workflow
1. Add entity extraction logic to the n8n upload workflow
2. Use OpenAI API to extract entities from document content
3. Store entities in a database (Cosmos DB or similar)
4. Create relationships between entities

### Option 3: Use Alternative Processing
1. Implement client-side entity extraction
2. Send extracted entities with the upload
3. Store in search index for retrieval

## üìà Impact on System:

**Without Knowledge Graph:**
- ‚ùå No cross-client insights
- ‚ùå No entity-based search
- ‚ùå No relationship mapping
- ‚ùå Limited contextual understanding
- ‚úÖ Basic document storage works
- ‚úÖ General Q&A works

**With Knowledge Graph:**
- ‚úÖ Find similar projects across clients
- ‚úÖ Track contractor relationships
- ‚úÖ Analyze cost patterns
- ‚úÖ Smart material recommendations
- ‚úÖ Enhanced search accuracy
- ‚úÖ Contextual chat responses

## üéØ Next Steps:

1. **Immediate:** Fix Azure Function authentication
2. **Short-term:** Deploy knowledge-graph function properly
3. **Medium-term:** Implement entity extraction in n8n
4. **Long-term:** Build full graph database with Cosmos DB

## üìù Testing Commands:

### Test Document Upload:
```bash
curl -X POST https://workflows.saxtechnology.com/webhook/ask-foreman/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file": "BASE64_CONTENT", "fileName": "test.pdf", "clientName": "TestClient"}'
```

### Test Chat Query:
```bash
curl -X POST https://workflows.saxtechnology.com/webhook/ask-foreman/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Your question", "client": "ClientName"}'
```

### Test Azure Function:
```bash
curl -X POST https://saxtech-functionapps.azurewebsites.net/api/knowledge-graph \
  -H "x-functions-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

## üí° Conclusion:

The knowledge graph infrastructure exists but is **not fully operational**. The system can store documents and answer general questions, but cannot extract entities or build relationships. To fully enable the knowledge graph, you need to either:
1. Fix the Azure Function deployment and authentication
2. Implement the logic in your n8n workflows
3. Use an alternative processing method

The good news is that the foundation is in place - you just need to connect the pieces properly.
