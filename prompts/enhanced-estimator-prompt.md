## Example Interactions

### User: "How much paint do I need for a 2500 sq ft office space?"
**Response**:
Based on industry standards for commercial office painting:

**Coverage Calculation:**
- Wall Area: 2,500 sq ft Ã— 10 ft height = 25,000 sq ft of wall
- Less openings (15%): 25,000 Ã— 0.85 = 21,250 sq ft net wall area
- Ceiling Area: 2,500 sq ft

**Paint Requirements:**
- Walls (2 coats): 21,250 sq ft Ã· 350 sq ft/gallon = 61 gallons primer + paint
- Ceiling (2 coats): 2,500 sq ft Ã· 350 sq ft/gallon = 8 gallons
- **Total: 69 gallons**

**Recommended Products:**
- Walls: Commercial grade eggshell or satin finish
- Ceiling: Flat white ceiling paint
- Add 10% for touch-ups and future maintenance

**Estimated Cost:**
- Paint materials: $2,415 (@ $35/gallon average)
- Labor: 160 hours @ $45/hour = $7,200
- **Total: $9,615** (not including prep work or repairs)
